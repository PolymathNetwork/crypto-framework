# Asset Granularity Unique Identity

## Simple Claim Prover
CDD Claims and Scope Claims are types of claims that can be attached to an investor's identity on the PolyMesh.

CDD Claims are generated by a PolyMesh trusted CDD provider during the CDD process(see
[cdd-register-did][cdd-register-did]), and privately link an investor's unique id (`investor_unique_id`, which
is kept secret between the investor and CDD provider) to their on-chain identity (`investor_did`, the serialized
[IdentityId][IdentityId] of the investor). A CDD claim can be inputted to the `polymath-scp` CommandLine Interface (CLI)
in JSON format. Let's assume it is saved as `my_cdd_claim.json`:
```
{
  "investor_did":[32_bytes_array],
  "investor_unique_id":[32_bytes_array]
}
```

Scope Claims are generated by the investors and reference a specific scope (e.g. asset). The investor
must generate this claim for each identity that they wish to use to invest in a particular asset (i.e. scope).
Depending on the use case the `scope_did` could be the Blake2b hash of the asset's ticker name (e.g. `AAPL`).
Let's assume this structure is saved as `my_scope_claim.json`:
```
{
  "scope_did":[32_bytes_array],
  "investor_unique_id":[32_bytes_array]
}
```

Given these 2 files and the message/data that the investor wants to prove, the `polymath-scp` CLI can be used
to generate a confidential proof which PolyMesh will later use to verify the integrity of scope claims as well
as aggregate all investments made by identities that share the same unique identifier (`investor_unique_id`)
without having the knowledge of the actual unique id.

## Simple Claim Verifier
The `polymath-scv` CLI can be used to verify the proof the same way that the PolyMesh would do.

## Build the CLIs

```bash
cd crypto-framework
cargo +nightly build --release
```

The two CLIs (`polymath-scp` and `polymath-scv`) are placed in `crypto-framework/target/release`. You can
call them by adding `crypto-framework/target/release` to your `PATH` environment variable,
or call them using the absolute path to the CLI file.

## Run the CLIs

To run the `simple_claim_prover` example:
```bash
polymath-scp -v -c my_cdd_claim.json -s my_scope_claim.json -p proof.json -m "my claim"
```
For your convenience we have provided an optional flag (`-r`) to randomly generate the inputted JSON file.
```bash
polymath-scp -v -r -c rand_cdd_claim.json -s rand_scope_claim.json -p proof.json -m "my claim"
```
This command will generate a random CDD claim as well as a random scope claim and save them into separate JSON files.
From these claims it will generate a proof of possession of the unique id over the `"my claim"` message, and save
it to `proof.json`.

```bash
polymath-scp -h
```

To run the `simple_claim_verifier` example:

```bash
polymath-scv -p proof.json -m "my claim"
```

It will determine whether `proof.json` is a valid proof of possession of the unique ID.
To learn more about the usage, run:

```bash
polymath-scv -h
```
